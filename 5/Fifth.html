    <dt><strong>Front-end :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Front-end development, also known as client-side development, focuses on creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. Front-end developers work on the part of the application that users interact with directly in their web browsers. This includes designing and coding the layout, visuals, and interactive elements using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end developers ensure that websites are visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Back-end :
    </strong></dt>
    <dd>Back-end development, or server-side development, involves building the behind-the-scenes functionality of a website or web application. Back-end developers work on server logic, databases, and server infrastructure. They handle tasks such as data storage, retrieval, security, and server-side scripting. Back-end development often includes working with programming languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, or Node.js. Back-end developers ensure that the application's data and processes are secure and efficiently managed.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Full-stack Development :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Full-stack development encompasses both front-end and back-end development, making developers proficient in both aspects of web development. Full-stack developers have a comprehensive understanding of the entire web development stack, from server infrastructure and databases to user interface design and user experience. They can work on all parts of a web project and bridge the gap between front-end and back-end components. Full-stack development skills are valuable in building complete and functional web applications, allowing developers to work on all aspects of a project or specialize in either front-end or back-end based on project requirements.</dd>
